# CSV Reader 

Compare two CSV files using pandas

# Project Description 
* To compare two Excel sheets with different numbers of rows and find the differences using Python, you can use the pandas library. Pandas is a powerful tool for working with data in Python, and it makes it easy to work with Excel files. Here's an example of how you could compare two Excel sheets with different numbers of rows and find the differences using Python and pandas:

* First, you'll need to install the pandas library if you don't already have it. You can do this by running pip install pandas at the command line.

* Next, you'll need to load the two Excel sheets that you want to compare into pandas dataframes. You can do this using the pandas.read_excel() function. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the first Excel sheet into a dataframe
df1 = pd.read_excel('sheet1.xlsx')

# Load the second Excel sheet into a dataframe
df2 = pd.read_excel('sheet2.xlsx')
```
